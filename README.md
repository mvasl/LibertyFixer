# LibertyFixer
___

A tool to (improperly) fix Cyberpunk 2077 crashing after the Phantom Liberty update.

It was hacked together in 30 minutes, was only tested on AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, 
but should, in theory, work with any AMD GPU. 

Nvidia/Intel GPU's support may come at some later time, but I hope CDPR will fix their game before I do)
